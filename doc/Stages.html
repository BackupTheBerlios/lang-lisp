<h2>Lang development stages</h2>

<h3>Core development</h3>
<p>The type system, resolving system, and manner of executing is developped. It is looked
into whether this core can support programming methods and concepts with libraries. The goal 
is that the core should do as little as possible, and still be able to optimize, but be able
to do as much as possible with libraries.</p>
<p>I will probably refrain from making optimalization mechanisms at this point, because then
it will take longer to get into actually useable states.</p>

<h4>Required milestones</h4>
More may still be added.
<ul>
  <li>All working as should to create any library.</li>
  <li>Conditionals, loops, functions, etc., macro creation from inside Lang.</li>
  <li>A working 'Hello world', and a few working simple examples, at least one with (simple)graphics. 
Must test all the previous things.</li>
  <li>Good unit tests. <a href="unittest-core.html">Here</a> are unit tests to be past.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Libraries development</h3>
<p>Beyond this point, less-then-core libraries, optimalization methods, and possibly
 conversion to more languages are developped. This can be done with more people more easily,
 since the libraries are largely separate.(They may aswel be separate projects.) Of course,
 it might need to be discussed how to keep the style consistent. A list of capabilities that 
should be in the language before going to the next step.(Again, i might add stuff.)</p>

<h4>Required milestones</h4>
<ul>
  <li>Simple or automatic usage of functions and structures from C.</li>
  <li>Connections to many C libraries.</li>
  <li>A loop, or iterate -like macro (preferably iterate-like)</li>
  <li>Optimalization methods addable via libraries.</li>
  <li>Mathematics and statistical functions, graphing functions.</li>
  <li>A project to show it off a little.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Continued development, and promotion</h3>
<p>When enough libraries for good use are developped, promoting the language for actual 
use can start. Meanwhile, there is no reason to stop making more libraries, improve 
optimization, and languages to convert to, and of course, fine tuning of existing code.</p>
