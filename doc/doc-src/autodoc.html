<h2>Autodoc stuff.</h2>

In general, i have not filled all the documentation strings. 
Should add documentation strings to packages, classes and such.
Also, the auto-documentation tool i used
 -<a href="http://weitz.de/documentation-template/">documentation-template</a>- is a hack.
Couldn't get <a href="http://common-lisp.net/project/tinaa/">tinaa</a> included into my 
lisp environment..

<h3>Lang</h3>
Lang package itself doesn't have exported symbols yet, and the autodoc 
system can't be configured to output them anyway.

<h3>Read</h3>
Well, i might change it.. again -_-. <a href="autodoc/dt-read.html">read</a>

<h3>Namespace</h3>
Stuff implementing namespaces. I have a little more externalized then i would want to.
<a href="autodoc/dt-namespace.html">namespace</a>

<h3>Argument</h3>
Provides function being exactly destructuring-bind, and one that parses the arguments.
I have yet to autodoc it and don't have the package for it right now.
