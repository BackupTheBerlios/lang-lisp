<h2>Lang development stages</h2>

<a named="Core_development"><h3>Core development</h3></a>
<p>The type system, resolving system, and manner of executing is developped. It is looked
into whether this core can support programming methods and concepts with libraries. The goal 
is that the core should do as little as possible, it should be able to do as much as possible 
with libraries. Separate from the resolving of the functions(types), it will also need something 
to optimize.</p>
<p>I will initially probably refrain from making specific optimalization at this point, because then
it will take longer to get it useable. Optimalization mechanisms, however might be added to the
 milestones here.</p>

<a named="Required_milestones_core"><h4>Required milestones</h4></a>
More may still be added.
<ul>
  <li>All working as should to create any library, good (unit) <a href="core-test.html">tests</a>.</li>
  <li>Conditionals, loops, functions, etc., macro creation from inside Lang.</li>
  <li>A working 'Hello world', and a few working simple examples, at least one with (simple)graphics. 
Must test all the previous things.</li>
</ul>

<a named="Libraries_development"><h3>Libraries development</h3></a>
<p>Beyond this point, less-then-core libraries, optimalization methods, and possibly
 conversion to more languages are developped. This can be done with more people more easily,
 since the libraries are largely separate.(They may aswel be separate projects.) Of course,
 it might need to be discussed how to keep the style consistent. A list of capabilities that 
should be in the language before going to the next step.(Again, i might add stuff.)</p>

<p>Some things are very useful to have too, a loop/iterate macro set can make macro making easier
and prevent people wanting to change code in order to use it afterwards.</p>

<a named="Required_milestones_lib"><h4>Required milestones</h4></a>
<ul>
  <li>Simple or automatic usage of functions and structures from C.</li>
  <li>Connections to many C libraries.</li>
  <li>A loop, or <a href="http://common-lisp.net/project/iterate/#about">iterate</a> -like macro
    (preferably iterate-like)</li>
  <li>Optimalization methods addable via libraries.(Some groundwork might need to be done in the core stage? 
    Move it there?)</li>
  <li>Mathematics and statistical functions, graphing functions.</li>
  <li>A project to show it off.</li>
  <li>A proper website, with good tutorials and other learning resources.</li>
  <li>An icon for the language, a proper name for the language.</li>
</ul>

<a named="Continued_development_and_promotion"><h3>Continued development, and promotion</h3></a>
<p>When enough libraries are developped, promoting the language for actual 
use can start. Meanwhile, there is no reason to stop making more libraries, improve 
optimization, and languages to convert to, and of course, fine tuning of existing code.</p>
