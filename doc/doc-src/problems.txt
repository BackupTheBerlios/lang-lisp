Problems:

* The resolve-result needs to have matching out-names, or conversion 
to the resulting language (by to-c.lisp) won't work. This conflicts with 
the idea that the optimizer needs to run after resolving, since this way 
macros can only limitedly be optimized.
     Solutions:
       * Resolve allows for other macros, and those other macros will then 
       be transformed just before conversion to other languages.
       * Move macro optimizations to pre-resolving. Then they can't use 
       types as well.
       * Ignore, only do function optimizations. Don't use macros where
       higher order functions should be used. Need to implement higher 
       order functions for that, of course! (Makes sense imo)
