<h2>Unit tests for the Core development stage</h2>
<p>I will only unit test things if the test does not constitute reimplementing it. Also the thing 
tested should not be too simple. Good things to test are functions of which there is another function
that should be its inverse, and structures on which there are demands on what its state is like.</p>

<h3>Type getting/setting tests</h3>
<p>After setting a bunch of types, subsequent getting should get things correctly. Should also 
try getting less specific types then exist. It should work regardless if use-hash is on or off.
Perhaps should also include special types, but this might be inpractical. The resulting state
 of the structure holding the types should forfill its state correctness. 
Where <b>state correctness</b> is the following:</p>

<ul>
  <li>If you go down the more-specific slot of a typeset, it should always actually be more 
specific.</li>
  <li>What is in the more-specific list should never be coarser then each other.</li>
  <li>The more-specific list should be sorted to preference. Also, if a is preferred over b,
b should not be prefered over a.</li>
</ul>

<h4>Current state</h4>
<p>There is a in test/test-typeset.lisp. The preference check seems to fail, but it may be due 
to the test rather then the state. It does not miss any types.</p>

<h3>Filling/getting variables in structures test</h3>
<p>I should test the filling and getting variables in structures.(in type-util.lisp) This could go like this:
Make a random tree, find its variables. Make other random symbols(trees?) for its variables, and fill 
them into the tree with <code>type-fill</code>. Then with the first tree and the second tree, we 
should be able to get those exact random symbols back with <code>type-get-var</code>.</p>

<h4>Current state</h4>
Have a test that does non-special types. Succeeds. (Do special data too later.)

<h3>Test of small subset of evaluation</h3>
<p>I can test a subset of evaluation too. Make functions of a bunch of random argument types, the 
The types have an order, and the lowest of this order that is in an argument of a function 
always is the return type. Then the lowest type of all the entered variables should be the 
returning type of the whole.</p>

<h4>Current state</h4>
<p>Nothing done on it.</p>

<h3>Test of reader</h3>
<p>A test(test/test-reader.lisp) for the reader(reader.lisp) is just to write a random symbol tree, 
and then read it back, and check if the two are equal.</p>

<h4>Current state</h4>
<p>The text succeeds, but is only partial; doesn't check separators and some other features. Not
sure if it is needed to fully be tested.</p>

<h3>Test of argument-postioner.lisp</h3>
<p>Automatically make arguments, fill them and see if the result matches.</p>

<h4>Current state</h4>
<p>Nothing done yet. May consider it unneeded.</p>
