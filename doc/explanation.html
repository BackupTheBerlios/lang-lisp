<a name="What_it_is"><h2>What it is/what it wants to be</h2></a>

Lang is meant to become:
<ul>
  <li>A general purpose language, being able to convert to many languages. This is a
    far future goal.</li>
  <li>Different then earlier lisps(and languages) in its type system and how the user
    is capable to interact with it. It uses function overloading for functions and 
    macros. This should allow it to produce fast binaries via C.</li>
  <li>Modular, as much as possible must either be a library, or written in a very
    library-like manner. The specification should be the same way.</li>
  <li>Flexible, the language needs to be powerful enough to make many programming
    paradigms possible in libraries. These libraries also need to actually be made.</li>
  <li>Have sufficient libraries by being able to load from libraries from other languages, 
    like C.</li>
  <li>Popular with good programmers when it is ready. What is the point of a good
    programming language without users? Lang will however not be compromised to protect 
    users.(Although some libraries might.)</li>
</ul>


<a name="Syntax"><h3>Syntax</h3></a>
<p>Lang is written in trees like any lisp is. However, it may use alternative ways to produce them
See <a href="#Alternative_ideas_for_syntax">Alternative ideas for syntax</a>.
It must always be clear what tree the syntax creates.</p>

<a name="Defun"><h3>Defun</h3></a>
<p>For the record, here is how you write some basic stuff like <code>defun</code>.</p>
<code>(defun [keywords for function] name ([arguments])
    [body])</code><br>
<code>(defun [keywords for function] (setf name) ([set-to-argument] [arguments])
    [body])</code>
<p>Keywords for defun are things like :specify-as-needed, :inline.
Arguments name-type pairs, if it is just a symbol, the type is <code>(any)</code></p>
(See in <a href="#Special_qualifier_types">Special qualifier types</a> what that is.))


<a name="Types_with_argmuments"><h3>Types with arguments</h3></a>
<p>Types with arguments are the most important idea in Lang. Structures are written 
as having arguments, which are used for the types of its elements, in which
the arguments are filled in, with both full types and the arguments the structure
itself takes. A structure is written thusly:</p>
<code>(struct name ([arguments]) [elements])</code>
<p>Where elements are either symbols (again, of type <code>(any)</code>) or name-type
pairs possibly with keywords after. Like :init, whatever initial value is;
:arg, the argument keyword with which you create it; :reader :writer :accessor, 
automatically make reader and/or writer. But also :derive,(and :pass-on) meaning that
if no function is found, it tries to find one on this element.(And if it doesn't find 
it there, it goes to the next one.
(All the keywords still todo. <!--TODO-->)</p>

<p>An example: <code>(struct list-node (item-type)
  (next (ptr (list-node item-type))) (item item-type))</code><br>
Of course, you shouldn't make types circularly, but the pointer in this case
makes the size of the node finite. Also note that you can do stuff like give initial 
values, keywords for setting at creation, and class derivation with keywords.
(<!--TODO-->Last statement still idea.)</p>

<p>If you define a structure, any of its more specific types can be created. 
(I might call more specific finer and more general coarser.) A type is more 
specific then another type when you can equal the finer one by
 filling an argument. However, there are exceptions, for instance, <code>(any)</code>
is a type that is always more general, number types are set manually, and there will be
types like or and eql. Of course, all the deviate types need to be internally 
consistent. <!-- TODO make and link to number types, or. -->
</p>

<a name="Selection_based_on_types"><h3>Selection based on types</h3></a>
<p>Lang uses function overloading, this is also a subset of type inference. For functions,
it will look into multiple of the same name, and will pick one of the most specific.
I say 'one of' because which function to choose might be ambiguous if you only look at the 
specificness. For this reason, Lang has a preference in types, of always seeking the function
with the most specific rightmost. However, users should try to avoid making this type-preference 
an issue when actually coding. This means trying to keep down the number of arguments, 
or making the more specific cases just more efficient versions of the same.</p>
<p>Note that macros can use type selection as wel, in a way identical to that of functions,
but only for a fixed ammount of arguments at the beginning. I may do type selection in selection
of structures too.</p>

<a name="Special qualifier types"><h3>Special qualifier types</h3></a>
<p>There are a bunch of special qualifier types.</p>

<h4><code>(any)</code></h4>
<p>Just a type that is more general then any of the other types.</p>

<h4><code>(eql single-argument)</code></h4>
<p>This one allows you to specify exactly what an argument is, or that it is some 
number exactly, and each should have it seperately.</p>
<p>If it is one exact value, it should just have that number right behind it like:
 <code>(eql 1)</code>, <code>(eql 2.4)</code>, <code>(eql 'noodle)</code>.</p>
<p>If it is an exact number, but unspecified.(Use on functions with flags like :specify-as-used)
Hou have: <code>(eql (integer n))</code>, <code>(eql (number x))</code>,
<code>(eql (symbol sym))</code> See below.</p>

<h4><code>`(eql (,type-of-eql ,var) ,@clauses)</code></h4>
<p>A type that matches any of the eql, type-of-eql being integer, number, 
symbol. For clauses, see clause type. Functions that are this way need something like
:only-record :specify-as-used. (<!--TODO-->Maybe should add the keywords automatically?)</p>

<h4><code>(eql* single-argument)</code></h4>
<p>(<!--TODO-->Completely in idea phase)Same as <code>eql</code>, excepth this one also checks non-eql types for equality. 
  This way this can work (Which would stack-overflow with eql.):</p>
<p><code>(defun factorial ((n (eql* 1))) 1)</code></p>
<p><code>(defun factorial ((n (integer))) (* n (factorial (- n 1))))</code></p>

<p>This might be better: (As long as tail recursion not optimized.)</p>
<p><code>(defun factorial ((n (integer))) (let1 (m 1) (do-times n (i) (set- * m i))))</code></p>

<h4><code>(clause &rest clauses)</code></h4>
<p>(<!--TODO-->Completely in idea phase.) Something will only fall into the 
clause type if all the statements are true. Eql, when the actual thing is still 
variable can also have clauses.</p>

<h4><code>(or &rest types)</code></h4>
<p>(<!--TODO-->Completely in the idea phase.)With this one, the type is one of the arguments of the or. These things come out of
conditional statements, like <code>cond</code>, <code>if</code>, etcetera. For speed it
might be a good idea to prevent them, or make sure the seperation is done at compile-time.</p>

<h4><code>(function output-type arg-types)</code></h4>
<p>These types describe functions. Their first argument is the output type of a function.</p>

<h4><code>(function-adapt symbol)</code></h4>
<p>(<!--TODO-->untested)A function that adapts to the types that are used. <code>(fun-of 'function-symbol)</code>
produces a function with type <code>(function-adapth (eql 'function-symbol))</code>, 
calling it is the same as just calling function-symbol directly.</p>

<a name="Number_types"><h3>Number types</h3></a>
There will be a bunch of different numbers. Rules are:
<ul>
  <li>Number most general real number.</li>
  <li>Fraction coarser then integer.</li>
  <li>Floating point always coarser then integer and fraction.</li>
  <li>Complex numbers are coarser then real numbers if the type of the real component
is coarser then the real number one.</li>
</ul>
<!--TODO--> Only standard size integers and floating points are currently done.

<a name="Optimalization"><h3>Optimalization</h3></a>
<p>I am planning to have at least macro-like optimalization. Maybe with typelike matching. 
But i am also planning to look at having equivalences and some way of estimating when to
switch to the 'other side' of the equivalence, or if it ca check through a chain of 
equivalences to find better ways of computing.</p>

<p>Of course, if it can do that, you can also devise a way to make it prove some 
theorems, automatically, very limitedly, but when a human gives it enough steps, it can 
verify them all one by one. If we ever get here, a spin off/additional goal for project 
can be considered. It is at this moment far-off.</p>

<a name="Alternative_ideas_for_syntax"><h3>Alternative ideas for syntax</h3></a>
<p>Trying to think up syntaxes to write trees is comparatively trivial, compared to the 
rest of the project. Of course the code to read a tree is completely seperate from the 
rest of the code. I am still open to debate on all of them.</p>
<ul>
  <li> Sublisting, ';' starting sublisting and determining how it is, 
    and '|' stopping it: <code>(defun meh (a (int); b (int)) | + a b;)</code> -&gt;
    <code>(defun meh ((a (int)) (b (int))) (+ a b))</code>
    Requires programmer discretion in use, but looks a lot cleaner when 
    used properly, it is implemented, and i decided to use it.</li>
  <li> XML-like marking, allows the programmer to make long s-expressions
    repeat themselves so it is clear 'which hook' is closed.
    <code>[namespace name] .... lots of code ....[/namespace name]</code>
    I would require the user to repeat the exact same thing. Only issue i see 
    with it that people might use it on overly long functions.
    Not so sure about it for that reason.</li>
  <li> <p>Other types of hooks. { code } -&gt; (progn code) However, seems silly 
      just to use it on progn.. Factor (i superficially looked at it) makes its tree with 
      different kinds of objects, also using '{}' to indicate arrays. I am not going to do that, 
      but maybe allow: <code>{..}</code> -&gt; <code>({} ..)</code> and <code>[..]</code> -&gt;
      <code>([] ..)</code>.</p>
    <p>Problem with it is that it is unnatural to write macros using them, distracts from 
      actually making macros that do the job well by themselves. I say nay.
  </li>
  <li> Shorter ways of writing lambdas? Instead of writing
    <code>(lambda (x y z) (+ (sqr x) (sqr y) (sqr z)))</code> write
    <code>($l (+ (sqr $1) (sqr $2) (sqr $3)))</code>. There was a 
    <a href="http://www.lispforum.com/viewtopic.php?f=2&t=147">discussion</a>.(Not started by me.) 
    Not really a syntax issue though.
  </li>
