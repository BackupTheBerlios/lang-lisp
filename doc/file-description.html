<b><p>Note that a lot of this is untested/unfinished, and that this file itself might be 
out-of date.</p><p><font size="5">The links don't work.</font></p></b>

<h3>Utilities</h3>
<p><a href="argument-positioner.lisp"><b>argument-positioner.lisp</b></a></p>
<p>Some stuff implementing extracting list elements based on an
argument list like that of macros. Can do argument sublists, has
&amp;optional, &amp;key, &amp;rest. TODO also allow for default
values for &amp;key, &amp;optional.</p>
<h3>Reading system</h3>
<p><a href="reader.lisp"><b>reader.lisp</b></a></p>
Code to read in s-expressions from files. Currently rather old code. TODO Probably
need to rewrite, in order to:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Use read-line, because it doesn't make sense to have newlines as nthing else then
	whitespace anyway.</p>
	<li>Reading in a series
	of tokens first, and then make it a tree using those tokens that can
	do that.</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Macros at this
		level? Or would that make things too complicated? Maybe implement,
		but not use in language.</p>
		<li>Additional tree
		specification methods like the sublisting with ;, | ? and with
		xml-like marking?</p>
	</ul>
</ul>
<h3>Processing system</h3>
<p><a href="fun-base.lisp"><b>fun-base.lisp</b></a></p>
<p>Contains class of state of resolving types and macro, and some
functions for namespaces,(partly) getting symbols in current
namespace. (Bit of a mix of stuff.)</p>
<p><a href="typeset.lisp"><b>typeset.lisp</b></a></p>
<p>Key part of lang, can select the most specific matching version of
a class of things specified by a list of types to do so from. Can of
course also add these things. 
</p>
<p>Used for function overloading but also macro overloading (latter
needs to have number of arguments for which the type is needed.)</p>
<p>TODO what to do about type-eql function? Type macros? What does it
need to support 'or type, or numbers with ranges?</p>
<p><a href="typeset-named.lisp"><b>typeset-named.lisp</b></a></p>
Basically typeset through the getting-symbols of fun-base.lisp.</p>
<p><a href="type-util.lisp"><b>type-util.lisp</b></a></p>
Some utilities regarding types. Most importantly, filling in variables in types and
getting what the variables are in a more general type.</p>
And out-type, which gets the type of things. For a function it might need to use
typelist-fill.</p>
<p><a href="fun-get.lisp"><b>fun-get.lisp</b></a></p>
<p>Defines class for lang functions and uses typeset select to make
function getting and setting. Except for when it resolves a function
with the flag :specify-as-used, it is pretty much a wrapper around
typeset-select. TODO make &amp;optional and &amp;key arguments
possible by making a macro that returns with :defer-to-fun.</p>
<p><a href="mac-get.lisp"><b>mac-get.lisp</b></a></p>
<p>Defines class for both normal and raw macros. Rawmac's can get the
state of the processing and, as such, add variables, normal macros
can only return a manipulated code tree. 
</p>
<p>Also can use types of the arguments to determine what macros to
use, some fixed number of first arguments does this.</p>
<p>Note that conversion to other code, like C, depends on the results
of a few macros.(Like those in macs/macs.lisp) 
</p>
<p><a href="fun-resolve.lisp"><b>fun-resolve.lisp</b></a></p>
<p>Processing code, expanding macros, and determining which functions
should be used in the function overloading. 
</p>
<p>It is 'function inference' instead of 'type inference',
appararently function overloading and type inference 'overlap',
however, it might be useful to do some type inference too, based on
when a function is defined with argument types too general for the
functions used in its body. 
</p>
<p><a href="states.lisp"><b>states.lisp</b></a></p>
<p>This file contains extensions of the base states that various
macros use. It needs to be in one file because it uses class
derivation. TODO macros should be able to extend the state as needed.</p>
<h3>Optimization</h3>
<p>This is to be done after the initial processing. Don't really have
good ideas yet, but some notes: 
</p>
<ul>
	<li>Finding patterns and once found
	call optimizing function. (A little macro-like)</p>
	<li>Having equivalences with a either
	a direction in which it is more efficient, or an estimator to check
	both sides, or call an optimizing function. 
	</p>
	<li>When to inline? Should peek inside functions to find
	equivalences that might warrant inlining even if it shouldn't if you
	don't regard equivalences. 
</ul>
<p>I do not really know how to handle this, but the first one should
be doable with typeset-like matching. 
</p>
<h3>Conversion to other languages/machine readable code</h3>
<p><a href="to-c.lisp"><b>to-c.lisp</b></a></p>
<p>Conversion of fun-resolve result to C. Depends on results from
some of the base macros.</p>
<h4>TODO</h4>
<ul>
	<li>Conversion to lisp would be nice!
	A nice way to get for macros to be created in lang itself. Forth is
	also an option.</p>
	<li>Many of the stuff it does could
	apply for other languages too. Maybe it should convert to some
	'in-between' state.</p>
	<li>Letting conversion to C also
	optionally produce some interfacing of the C result to common lisp. 
	</p>
	<li><p>If i want to make it wholly dynamic, dependencies of
	functions need to be noted, and functions updated when other
	functions change. 
	</p>
</ul>
<h3>Declaration of primitive elements</h3>
<p><a href="macs/macs.lisp"><b>macs/macs.lisp</b></a></p>
<p>Basic macros. Currently does: quote, namespace progn, let, (let1,
let-ret)</p>
<p><a href="macs/mac-fun.lisp"><b>macs/mac-fun.lisp</b></a></p>
<p>Function creation and function as an argument usuage. Does: defun,
set, will-defun, specialize-fun, lambda, fun-of(a symbol), funcall,
flet, (flet1). TODO test funcall and those, re-test flet.</p>
<p><a href="macs/mac-loops.lisp"><b>macs/mac-loops.lisp</b></a></p>
Makes you loops. Does: while, do, do1, do-times. (Note that i plan to 
make do-times able to do it without
loop, if the count is (eql(number n)))</p>
<p><a href="macs/mac-cond.lisp"><b>macs/mac-cond.lisp</b></a></p>
Macros for conditional statements.
TODO need to make the 'or type work properly, hmm, maybe just force
it to be a single type first..</p>
<p><a href="macs/struct.lisp"><b>macs/struct.lisp</b></a></p>
<p>Has classes and adds to state class to keep track of which
structures are already there. 
</p>
<p>Also defines macros to create functional structure types. (Similar
to templates in C++.) Also macros to access slots, and get their
size. TODO add 'structure macros' here? Support 'or, etc.</p>
<p><a href="macs/lib.lisp"><b>macs/lib.lisp</b></a></p>
<p>Macro to load files. Macro inside should(next to progn?) in
principle be able to be the only manually loaded macro. TODO make it
so.</p>
<p><a href="macs/program.lisp"><b>macs/program.lisp</b></a></p>
<p>Entirely still to be made. I
want to make programs their own namespace, with a 'main function, a
structure with the variables, and all its functions preceded with
this structure.</p>

<h3>Types</h3>
Basic types.

<h3>Libraries</h3>
TODO make rules when something is considered a(what level of) library. 
</p>

<p><b><a href="lib/array1.lisp">lib/array1.lisp</a>, <a href= "lib/array1.lang">lib/array1.lang</a></b>
<p>Array of one dimension. Supports constant-lengths when more specific 
then (array1 (eql (integer n)) item-type).
</p>
<p><b><a href="lib/c-math.lisp">c-math.lisp</a></b></p>
<p>Allows use of cmath.h C library. Fairly simple just defining of the 
function and how C calls them. Convert to .lang file when macros can 
go lang-side.
</p>
