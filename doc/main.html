<h2>Lang(working title) project homepage</h2>
<p>This is the home page of the lang project. It is very early in development, you might even find todos 
in the website. Currently the website is not designed to attract anyone in particular. Please don't 
advertise this language in a way to suggest that it anywhere near ready to be used for actual programming.
<a href="https://developer.berlios.de/projects/lang-lisp/">Here</a> is the Berlios project page.</p>

<h3>What Lang is intended to be</h3>
<p>I intend to make a lispy programming language, that treats types better then 
other lisps. One reason for this is that binaries from this can be faster. In order to produce faster binaries
it will be able to produce C code. (I am also considering Forth, because it has a repl.)
 I will also try to make libraries able to give the user access to many programming methods and concepts. 
<a href="explanation.html">Read further explanation</a> for a more detailed description.(And some considerations.)</p>

<h4>License</h4>
<p>Because i am 'a follower' of (large portions of)the <a href="http://www.gnu.org/philosophy/philosophy.html">
GNU philosophy</a>, the code of the project will be under the Affero GPL license. It is the Affero license rather then 
the ordinary GPL to prevent people from providing compilation as a service, and not making improvements of the source code 
available.</p>

<h3>Stages of development</h3>
<p>Currently i am developing the 'core'. Here are <a href="stages.html">more stages and milestones</a>.</p>

<h3>Getting and using the code</h3>
<p>The code isn't very user-friendly at the moment, it is available in the
 <a href="https://developer.berlios.de/git/?group_id=10613">git repository</a>, Berlios produces a
 <a href="http://download.berlios.de/gitdumps/lang-lisp-git.tar.gz">daily tarball</a> of it.
I think much of it is fairly well written. (to-c.lisp and reader.lisp being less good in particular.)</p>

<p>s.lisp contains some 'scrap' code, to playtest, maybe i need to have a more formal usage testings.
in test/. It is likely that not everything in s.lisp will work.</p>

<h3>Course of action by you</h3>
<ul>
  <li>If you're not interested in developing languages. Please come back later :), maybe there will
be an interesting new language to learn.</li>
  <li>If you're knowledgable enough, and interested in suggesting something, read
 the <a href="explanation.html">Explanation</a>, look in the
 <a href="https://developer.berlios.de/forum/?group_id=10613">forum</a> for suggestions already 
there and post in the forum. The purpose of suggesting is to see if the requested feature 
can/should be implemented in the language, and how. I mainly hope to find features that
can not be written with a library with the the core language as-is, so i can change the core 
language so that it can. When it can be written as a language, the </li>
  <li>If you're interested, knowledgeable, skilled, and want to help develop, you can also post in
the forum. The problem is that i do not know how to make co-operation work at this point, but maybe 
that can be solved. Note that i highly value brevity, consistency and simplicity.
Also, the project can be paralelized more in later stages.</li>
